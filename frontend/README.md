# Frontend

### Country select
I used `react-select` because is more user friendlly in comparison to a regular select with 250 options

### Search Country
When you search for a country, the top 10 table will show the results.

When the search input gets clear the top 10 countries will show again

### Voting
You can vote again by refreshing the page
